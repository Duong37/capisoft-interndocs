***Task: Recreate the Following Figma design using React & Chakra UI***

- Use your existing codebase
- https://www.figma.com/file/MAmfdwQReXWL0FqHhKSyfo/React?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=gKVTMyG6Uja2O8cw-1
- Do the following pages:
    - **React/Dashboard/Reviews/Grid** under a new route reviews
    - **React/Dashboard/Reviews/List** under route users (take inspiration from it - adapt it in such a way that it lists useful information about users)
    - **React/Dashboard - under route dashboard, use recharts.js as the charting library**
    - Create a login screen using the same color palette and theming of the Figma screens
- Create a styled system in Chakra UI, based on the Figma design
- Make the page responsive (use Chrome Developer Tools to simulate smaller devices, like a phone or tablet)v
